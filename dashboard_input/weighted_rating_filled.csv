About The Expendables 3In THE EXPENDABLES 3, Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham) and the rest of the team come face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill… or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables’ most personal battle yet.<img src="" />Lionsgate and Millennium Films present a Nu Image production.

halflife 2,220,0.9449552094866084,"1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.
		NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.
		The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.
		The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:

Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.
Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.
Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.
AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.

When you play it you feel like you’re actually playing a Xiao Xiao stick animation video. We took inspiration from every kung-fu film we’ve seen. Every bit of effort was poured into delivering an easy to play game that was as addictive to play as Tetris.Every Press Matters! DO NOT BUTTON MASH!One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there’s no enemy in front of you, you’re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you’re going to get hit. It’s a simple system but it’s ruthless to button mashers. We spent much time setting up visual and audio queues as well as many warnings trying to steer players away from their natural button mashing tendencies.","Experience cinematic kung-fu battles in the fastest, most intense brawler the indie world has ever seen!

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary.

Our debut game, Flight of the Icarus, was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game CreaVures in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game.We released Guns of Icarus Online in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - Guns of Icarus Alliance, the ultimate and definitive Guns of Icarus experience - which released in March 2017.","Assemble your crew, take to the skies in the premier PvP airship combat game. Guns of Icarus Online is all about flying massive airships, shooting big turret weapons, and working as a team for supremacy of the skies.

From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.

Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead.

dmc devil may cry,220440,0.9262470507544732,"In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action, fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but inject a more brutal and visceral edge. The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory’s expertise and Capcom’s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title.Key FeaturesSurvive Limbo - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante. The world will transform in real-time and try to block off and even kill our hero. Our protagonist will have to master demonic powers to shape Limbo the way he sees fit, while perfecting his angelic skills to traverse this hazardous, twisted world. Who is Dante? – Explore a retelling of Dante’s origin story in a gripping narrative featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters, including Vergil, Dante’s twin brother. Unbridled action – The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat returns with the addition of new Angel and Demon weapons and abilities, all designed to dispatch the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache. Weapons include: “Rebellion”: Dante’s trusted sword, given by his father Sparda, provides a great mix of combos and attacks, great for sending enemies skyward. “Ebony & Ivory”: These guns are good for keeping enemies at bay, maintaining combos and juggling enemies in the air. “Arbiter”: a demonic axe that can deliver massive blows and break through enemy shields. “Osiris”: an angelic scythe with fast attacks and great for crowd control. “Eryx”: powerful demonic gauntlets that pack enough punch to parry even the strongest attacks and juggle the heaviest enemies. Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA – Capcom staff, including team members from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry franchise. Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC’s high-octane combat.","In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action.",['Ninja Theory'],https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/220440/ss_5e89cc2ac0468afa40bd9bd6932b41a0db9016f5.600x338.jpg?t=1644283036,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/220440/header.jpg?t=1644283036,29.99

banished,242920,0.9254796349055666,"In this city-building strategy game, you control a group of exiled travelers who decide to restart their lives in a new land. They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland.

The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.

Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.

There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.

The success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.","In this city-building strategy game, you control a group of exiled travelers who decide to restart their lives in a new land.

It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. RolesTown of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/rolesGame PhasesNightThe night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. DayThe day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. DefenseThe defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows!Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging!CustomizationPlayers are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from.AchievementsThere are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game.

After that, they can play the Song of the Day, everyday, as many times as they want.Is there a mode that focuses on dodging blocks?Yes, there's a new Ninja mode. It has a big bonus for hitting no spikes and creates intense spike fields to weave through. It’s faster than regular Mono and the second-to-second challenge of avoiding spikes is harder. For even more challenge there’s ninja turbo. It’s too fast for you.What’s new about the Puzzle modes in Audiosurf 2:Just as with Mono mode, your timing on Puzzle modes is now more important than ever. Push, Shuffle, Erase, or Scoop blocks at the just the right moments to take full advantage of multiplier powerups that come at the most intense moments of songs.Can players make their own mods and skins to share on Steam Workshop?Yes!

Therefore, I designed this ARPG 

battle system which requires no attack button to play.

Eternal Senia is the realization of this concept.

rimworld,294100,0.9198337508200798,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.Trade with passing ships and caravans.Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.Discover a new generated world each time you play.Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at  non-English translations are made by fans.)","A sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.

Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux.Multiplayer Game Modes:Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or ""tug of war"".Ambush --- A high value target (""HVT"") must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.Cooperative Game ModesCheckpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.","Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience.",['New World Interactive'],https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222880/ss_4f5e3138708d1d7c9b0f724862bacc17dc2cbb77.600x338.jpg?t=1610560212,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222880/header.jpg?t=1610560212,12.49

Whether you play as the legendary general or against him, the outcome of war can never be guaranteed. The course of history relies on your ability to lead your troops through the most intense battles as never seen before in a Total War game.About The Peninsular CampaignThe Peninsular Campaign is an independent campaign based on the conflict in the Spanish Peninsula between 1811 and 1814. It was during this era that the Spanish resistance gave their style of fighting its name: Guerrilla, or the “little war”.Play the campaign from three different perspectives, each with a unique feel:•	The French fight to keep resistance at bay while converting regions to their political alignment.•	The British are very limited for regions at the start but receive enough income from Northern Europe and North America that they can afford to liberate regions back to the Spanish in return for Guerrilla aid.•	The Spanish also have a limited starting position but have permanent access to Guerrillas for effective battlefield use against the French. Choose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one of the most intense conflicts of the Napoleonic era.Key Features:•	A new and independent Iberian Peninsula campaign map featuring 32 controllable regions.•	5 new Guerrilla unit types, recruitable by all nations, adept at battlefield stealth and with the added ability to deploy outside of their faction's deployment zones: Tiradores (Skirmisher Infantry), Cazadores, Lanceros (Lancer Cavalry), Husares (Light Cavalry), Leader (General). •	28 new units in total, spread across the three playable nations including the British 95th Rifles, the French Vistula Uhlans and the Spanish Coraceros Espanoles. •	Two new agents to enforce political conversion: •	Provocateurs (French and British nations only) have the ability to promote anti-opposition sentiment in regions, incite unrest, decreases turn time for research and passively spy.•	Priests (Spanish and Portuguese nations only) have the ability to promote anti-opposition sentiment in regions and incite unrest.•	A new Guerrillero agent for the Spanish nation: similar to a Spy but with the new ability to Harass enemy armies - lock them in place for a turn and cause them attrition.•	Political Alignment system which sees the French battle to increase pro-French sentiment throughout the peninsula.About Coalition Battle PackThe Coalition Battle Pack features 6 brand new units and contains the Battle of Friedland fought between France and Russia.The Battle of Friedland (14 June, 1807) with Napoleon's empire at its height, he took a chance and defeated Russia in detail, knocking them out of the war and bringing the Fourth Coalition to an end.Unit Descriptions: •	Lifeguard Hussars: This fast light cavalry unit is best used for dealing with skirmishers and artillery who can attack from long range.•	Coldstream Guards: Disciplined, well-trained and respected, these elite foot guards inspire nearby troops in battle. •	Archduke Charles' Legion: This highly-disciplined line infantry regiment excels at weapons drill and accuracy.•	Luetzow's Freikorps: Swift light cavalry, the riders of Luetzow’s Freikorps are excellent in melee and on the charge.•	Life Hussars: Sabre-armed light cavalry, the Life Hussars are powerful on the charge and effective in melee combat.•	Semenovski Lifeguard: Immaculately turned out, these elite guards have excellent morale and are superb when used against skirmish troops and artillery.About Heroes of the Napoleonic WarsThese exclusive elite units become available on the campaign map once you have made a specific technological advancement or own the relevant territory.They will appear in both single and multiplayer game modes.•	7th Lancers (France) •	Brandenburg Uhlans (Prussia) •	1st Hussars (Austria) •	15th Hussars (Great Britain) •	1st East Prussian Grenadier Battalion (Prussia) •	6th Regiment d'Infanterie Légère (France)•	17th Jäger Regiment (Russia)•	1st Regiment Emperor's Own (Austria)•	18th Regiment d'Infanterie de Ligne ""The Brave"" (France) •	Moscow Musketeers (Russia)About Imperial Eagle PackThese exclusive elite units become available on the campaign map once you have made a specific technological advancement or own the relevant territory.They will appear in both single and multiplayer game modes.•	Grand Battery of the Convention (France) •	HMS Elephant (Great Britain) •	Towarczys (Prussia) •	Royal Scots Greys (Great Britain) •	5e Regiment de Hussards (France) •	Pavlograd Hussars (Russia) •	8th Life Regiment (Prussia) •	47th (Czech) Regiment (Austria) •	88th Foot “Connaught Rangers” •	Archduke Ferdinand Cuirassiers (Austria)•	Lifeguard Cossacks (Russia)","Complete your Total War collection with this Definitive Edition of Total War: NAPOLEON, which includes all DLC and feature updates since the game’s release","['CREATIVE ASSEMBLY', 'Feral Interactive (Mac)']",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/34030/ss_bfed43a65786e3b004a5befb7fac5390f4390be0.600x338.jpg?t=1668768417,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/34030/header.jpg?t=1668768417,9.99

You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you aren’t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure.

cortex command,209670,0.864579822326754,"A project over eleven years in the making, Cortex Command has rich 2D pixel graphics coupled with an extremely detailed physics engine, which allows for highly replayable and emergent real-time action. There is also a turn-based strategic campaign mode which ties the tactical fights together, featuring persistent terrains that will accumulate the battle scars, debris, and bunker ruins through your entire campaign. Choose from several unique technology factions, each featuring their own sets of expendable soldier bodies, mechas, weapons, tools, and landing craft. Protect your brain, mine the gold, and destroy the enemy cortex in his bunker complex!Key Features:Fully destructible environments - The gold you need to excavate is sprinkled throughout the terrain of each scene. Use special digging tools to blast your way into the dirt and debris. All the pieces of bodies and ships from your struggles will fall to the ground and permanently add to the battlefield. Get more powerful (and expensive) diggers and you can even tunnel into your enemies' bunkers from below!Strategic metagame campaign – The intense, real-time tactical battles are put in a greater strategic context in the Campaign mode, thus giving each battle meaning and consequence. The gold-rich terrains on the planet and the defensive bunkers you build to defend them are persistent from fight to fight. This means there will be layers of debris, bunker ruins, tunnels, and corpses piled up in layers, telling the history of each place throughout each campaign played.In-game buying menu - At any time and place during the game, bring up a powerful menu to order new bodies and equipment, all delivered at the location and by the transport ship of your choosing. Rockets are cheaper but unreliable and harder to land. Drop ships are far more expensive but can quickly deploy entire groups of puppets onto difficult terrain. Ships and equipment returned to the TradeStar are refunded to your account.Build your own bunker - At the start of most missions, you are able to take your time and build your own command bunker from scratch. Easily design twisting tunnels and place doors, traps, and turrets to thwart your enemies' intrusions! Pre-deploy and equip bodies in and around your installation to prepare yourself for your objectives. Don't spend too much though, or you won't have enough funds left when the mission starts!Four-player cooperative and/or versus multiplayer - Gather your friends and plug in those game controllers! Play skirmish or campaign missions with or against up to three of your buddies. 2 vs 2, 1 vs. 3, 4 vs. the CPU - it's up to you! (rhyme intended). Flexible control settings allow you to use the keyboard, keyboard + mouse, or any generic game controller you can find and plug in.Built-in editors and modding - Several in-game editors allow you to easily create your own stuff. The game's engine is built to make it very simple to modify and add your own content.

brutal legend,225260,0.8329715954779944,"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike. Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.StoryThe vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.CombatBrütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.A Streaming Open WorldBrütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.Packed With Cameos and Voice TalentBrütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.Multiplayer Mayhem4v4 ""skirmish"" multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).MusicThe music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.","Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom.

Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril!

dirty bomb,333930,0.7527260152272606,"Update NotesWelcome to another Dirty Bomb update. In this one we're making a number of big changes and it's time for another make-over for Proxy.FRAGMENT CASE UPDATELong story short, Fragment Cases will no longer drop after you complete matches.Short story long, we know that many of you find the Fragment cases a little underwhelming when you earn them and they're added to your inventory, so we thought of a better way for you to earn Fragments in a bit of a more interesting way (Read the next section to find out what)Psst. If you have any Fragment Cases in your inventory, don't worry! Those won't be going anywhere, so you can save them for the memories or open them at your leisure.INCREASED LOADOUT CASE DROP RATESEnter the replacement for Fragment Cases! We've more than DOUBLED the drop rate of Loadout Cases at the end of matches so your Loadout Card earn rate will increase significantly. But how does this give you more Fragments? Well, if you decide to Recycle the cards you get from these cases you'll be earning a little more Fragments on average over time than you were before.With this update we've also added your Fragment balance to the front-end menu so you always know how many you have. This should also help new and existing players get to know the Crafting system a bit more, making it easier to interact with and giving it more visibility.OBSIDIAN OPERATIVE PROXYSkydaddy brought home the bacon in the last update with his epic Obsidian overhaul, but now it's Proxy's turn to bring home a bigger piece of bacon (and hopefully a better metaphor).When trying to describe this Obsidian it's difficult to not use words like ""f*****g awesome"", ""holy s**t"" and ""very nice"".

reign of kings,344760,0.7238717421124892,"Struggle to survive in a harsh medieval world. Hunt wildlife, mine resources, build structures, and craft weapons and armor in order to protect yourself. You may form a guild, bring war to all opposition, and try to seize the throne and become king!In Reign of Kings we allow you to collect resources and craft a wide variety of items needed to build a vast and powerful kingdom. We were primarily inspired by Rust & Chivalry in the development of this game.In addition to standard resources, you may compete over the Ancient Throne which resides in a throne room which overlooks the island. All players who are not part of the King's Guild are taxed on the resources they collect.The development of a melee combat system adds a gritty and visceral feeling to Reign of Kings that will allow players to become deeply immersed in a realistic and intense medieval survival experience.The world itself is designed to inspire competition and struggles for power.  Resource locations strategically spread throughout the game will create inequity and envy.  Players will have the ability to make war, or even capture and hold other players in order to get what they want.  Each player will have the power to decide the fate of the kingdom, or choose to entirely forego the responsibility of ruling the kingdom and roam the land as a freeman.CAPTUREPlayers have the ability to capture, hold, and execute other players. The player can capture them with rope or iron shackles. Once shackled, a player is no longer able to access their inventory aside from their orifice slot. The captured player's inventory is accessible for the captor to search them. Additionally, a rope will be attached to a prisoner which will allow them to be pulled in any direction their captor wishes. In order to avoid severe grieving situations, players can hide a sharp stone or lock pick in their orifice. This ""hidden"" item can help them escape capture or commit suicide.PUNISHMENT & DEATHPunishment & Death Once the player has control of a captive, there are several options available for managing a prisoner.  Options range from simply locking them in a cage or dungeon, public humiliation in the pillory, or simply executing them.THE ANCIENT THRONEThe Ancient Throne can be claimed by any player. Holding the Ancient Throne will grant its owner dominion over the entire map (change name of realm) and taxation rights over every other player.  The King of the Ancient Throne will receive the ability to collect the resource tax from every player within the game by visiting the Ravens Treasure Tree. The ravens automatically collect taxes in the game (behind the scenes of course, sneaky little things), and place them in the chests in their Treasure Tree.  In addition, the King of the Ancient Throne will have access to the Ancient Sword and the Ancient Crown. PRODUCTION & REFINING STATIONSPlayers will have the ability to collect resources and to craft them into useful items or building materials. Additionally, the progression mechanic for being able to craft higher valued items will be reliant on upgrading production stations to a higher level.  (Need a better quality sword?  Upgrade your anvil.)  Production and refining stations can craft or refine items as long as there are resources available unless ordered to do otherwise.  This allows the player the freedom to do other things while his kingdom remains productive. COLLECTION STATIONSCollection stations can be placed for grain and water. Collection stations will passively produce raw materials given they have enough fuel.These collection stations will be fully interactive and if left un-defended will offer a nice target for unscrupulous or enemy players.  With this in mind, the player will want to protect their resources. SIEGE EQUIPMENT AND RAIDING BASESOnce the players build stone walls and iron doors, players will not be able to simply bash their way inside. Players will now need to employ one of many different techniques for entry.The ranged option is to build trebuchets and launch large stones from afar at your opponent's castle. Players must place a counterweight to offset their projectile weight in order to get the range and destruction power they need from the stone they are launching. Players may also rotate the trebuchet. This alignment takes some practice but is very rewarding when set correctly.Players may choose to go a more stealthy route by crafting lock picks. Lock picks, however, are very hard to craft, and do not work on iron doors and iron gates.Players defending a base may employ their own trebuchet or set up a ballista which is great for killing other players at range.FIRST PERSON COMBAT Our combat systems allow melee and ranged combat to take center stage when war breaks out. Inspired by games like Chivalry, Reign of Kings' combat system is being tuned for satisfying, fast paced action. Players fight over the scarce resources and face off to defend or capture the throne.MELEE Players equip brutal weapons and use mouse buttons in an attempt to chop, slice, & stab through an opponent. Players will want to upgrade their weaponry to inflict the highest amount of damage as melee combat will always be dangerous and unpredictable.  Armor will be highly prized in Melee as it will keep you in a fight much longer. We support delimbing and decapitation of an opponent to represent the visceral and brutal experience of medieval close-quarters warfare.  A variety of period realistic weapons and armor will be available for the player to craft as they progress toward elder content.RANGEDRanged fighting in ROK will encompass the use of the bow, crossbow, javelin, and throwing stones. A good way for a player to stay alive in a fight during the early game will be to use ranged weaponry and speed.  Keeping out of sword range from a marauding knight is always a good idea, but even more so if you’re not equipped with the quality of armor that can absorb a hit or two. A simple bow and spear may be capable of taking down wild game, but may not provide enough piercing power to get through the finest plate male.  It’ll be important for the player to learn what kinds of weaponry are most effective in a fight as it will be critical knowledge to stay alive and have impact in a fight.  Higher tier Steel-pointed javelins will be able to pierce some armors, but the crossbow is the best option for punching a hole through the most heavily plated opponent at range.  The general rules of ranged weaponry will apply in ROK to determine functionality.  The bow will have the highest accuracy and reload speed, the crossbow will have greatest piercing power but is slow to reload, and thrown weapons will have the highest damage output, but are for short range use only.LOOTROK features a plague-ridden village that was cursed and abandoned by the old gods. This village features plague-ridden villagers, loot crates, and some high-end loot drops. It is dangerous to be in the village for long periods of time due to the disease that will damage the player's health.DEATHROK uses a roguelike death model similar to Rust.  When players die, they will fall to the ground as a ragdoll container that can be looted by other players.  Dead players will be provided with a random re-spawn option that can be improved through bed placement.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONPlayers begin the game by creating a unique character.  They will be able to refine their look in great detail by editing their body parts, choosing hair, and establishing a banner scheme to help them identify loyal friends during gameplay. You can also choose the voice style of your player's taunts.BUILDINGUsing the standard block, ramp and stairs, ROK building materials will consist of sticks, thatch, clay, wood, re-enforced wood, and stone.  Thatch, sticks, wood and clay will be widely available and often the first choice in material for beginning level housing. While these materials will offer shelter from poorly equipped enemies, they are easily breached by other players. Stone will offer much greater resistance to basic attacks and will only be damageable with siege tactics.  Players will be able to build their homes, towers and castles any way they like, but will need a great deal of space during elder content play in order to hold a large number of production, refining, and collection stations. Building castles will be a natural occurrence for players who reach elder content gameplay.  With the large number of production stations, refining stations, collection stations, chests, torture devices and respawn beds available for the player to build, comes the need to protect a large footprint of space.","Struggle to survive in a harsh medieval world.

sniper ghost warrior 2,34870,0.6589641856026884,"Check out the latest addition to the SGW franchise! src="" />About the GameSniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience. It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.Key Features	Motion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.	Realistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.	Refined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”	Improved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.	New Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. 	Various Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.	Bullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy – a bullet’s true stopping power – can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!	Bullet Penetration: concealment doesn’t necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait ‘til you see that on Bullet Cam!	Expanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world’s most advanced sniper rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on today’s battlefields.	New Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you.",Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights!,['City Interactive'],https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/34870/ss_9394c7938ba424434bfcd75a7511ca099ee21c3c.600x338.jpg?t=1604916772,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/34870/header.jpg?t=1604916772,9.99

grav,332500,0.643462557675538," Note: these are features already in the game.  They may be fleshed out more in the future, but they will be ready to rock from day 1Endless Worlds - The planets of GRAV are procedurally generated from composite parts.  This allows for a near infinite combination of biomes, alien sites, and dungeons.Gorgeous Visuals - Genre re-defining visuals allow you to experience fear, excitement, and trepidation in a way never seen before.Frenzied Combat - Compared to the zen-like calm of harvesting resources, combat is a wild ride which you can only hope to survive.  Both Melee and Shooting are the tools of death in GRAV.Player vs Player - Create alliances with other players, viciously kill them and take their belongings, or run from it all!  It's up to you how you interact with your fellow players.Play With Friends - GRAV is all about enjoying the experience with your friends. GRAV is client-server based so put up a server or join an official one!Powerful Base Construction - Supporting a modular contextual room based construction system allows for building bases quickly.  GRAV's building system can be used for creating an entire city, a quick base to fight off enemy players, or building an outpost deep in a dungeon to defend against the aggressive hordes. Extensive Crafting - Anything you can harvest or kill has a chance to drop Crafting Materials.  Building everything from the armor you wear, weapons you kill with, to the actual bases themselves comes from crafting.Dynamic Environmental Events - GRAV employs a procedural system to create world events for players.  A night could consist of blossoming night flowers, meteors raining down from the heavens, or even a horde of very angry alien wildlife trying to kill you and anything you have ever made. Procedurally Generated Dungeons - The planets of GRAV are full of dungeons that are created specifically for that planet.  Full of rare resources, dangerous foes, and environmental obstacles that provide a high-risk high-reward play area.Hostile Environments - Alien planets have a combination of semi safe areas and just plain you-are-probably-going to die locations!  The planets of GRAV are places where you must do whatever it takes to survive.Roadmap to get an idea of what features are coming to GRAV:","GRAV is a sand box experience where you explore a multitude of planets, hunt strange alien creatures, build and defend outposts, craft weapons and armor, and attempt to survive against other players in a hostile environment.","['BitMonster, Inc.']",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332500/ss_8f5466db24de7c62916825e436af0c331049366e.600x338.jpg?t=1478820787,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332500/header.jpg?t=1478820787,19.99

nether resurrected,247730,0.60487912697071,"NETHER...IS...BACK!  We have rolled back the game to Summer of 2014, when it first left Early Access and was still being developed by us, Phosphor Games Studio.  RIGHT NOW:- Single Player enabled: It was not possible before, but now it's working, and it's hard!  Have fun surviving the monster-filled urban apocalypse alone- No more micro-transactions: all items can be bought with in game cash- Multiplayer via player hosted servers! The old back end ripped out - no need for any login besides Steam.  You control your community, and nobody can take your game from you againWHAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT:- Custom server settings: you decided how many players, how many Nether, how much gun spawns, etc.- Modding tools![/b]- Bug fixes (including playing as a Nether, which was always pretty buggyGAME SUMMARY:Nether is a fast-paced survival game that forces you to make quick life-saving decisions in an unforgiving environment. In this post-apocalyptic urban world, death is waiting around every corner, at the top of high-rise buildings, and in the grasp of powerful teleporting creatures known as 'Nethers'. These creatures and the other players are real challenges to overcome, requiring tactical gameplay, awareness, stealth, and cooperation. To navigate this high-tension environment, you must use skill and cunning in order to scavenge, trade, craft or loot for food, weapons, supplies, and other resources necessary to stay alive in a desolate and dangerous city. Team up with other survivors and take advantage of group play, as a tribe, to complete treacherous world objectives, or play as a lone wolf in an attempt to endure the hostile environment. In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.Key FeaturesEXPLOREThe game's landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago, ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. SURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOTStart off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing.PLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONSPlayers can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money, experience and reputation. Perform vital supply runs between the markets, work with your tribe to take down the swarms of Nether lead by the vicious boss Reaper that sporadically surge to attack neighborhoods, or keep the creatures out of the Safezones by working in groups to repair the anti-nether devices when they fail.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Nether offers a wide variety of character customization and allows you to play as a male or female character. There is a huge selection of cosmetic items and player taunts to assert your individuality along with entire outfits to play roles like survivalist, soldier and biker - or even just play in your underwear.OTHERHost your own private servers and control your settings and player populationFirst-person perspective creates a true survival experienceMeld of PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) gameplayNew weapons and items become available as players explore the game worldUp to 64 players per game serverSingle purchase, downloadable client allows full game access without subscription","Nether is a unique, first-person, multiplayer urban survival experience.

romeros aftermath,349700,0.5856831054471558,"AFTERMATH END OF SERVICE NOTICEDear Players, We began Aftermath as a passion project 2 years ago that aimed to expand the Infestation/WarZ zombie survival universe and give players not only a harsh open world survival experience, but also let players build their own bases, claim land and store items. We ultimately chose to make the game free-to-play from the beginning in order to allow any curious player to try it without having to plunk down hard earned cash given how questionable early access titles can sometimes be. This free to play model worked for quite some time due to word of mouth, almost 2 years in fact, however, with the population dwindling we fear that we cannot keep servers online for much longer. Not long ago we made the decision to restrict new user registrations as well as halt the sale of in game currency to avoid potential disappointment from new players as the game had not been updated in the last 4 months. Unfortunately the economics of the game are not able to afford us the luxury of continued development and support for Aftermath. With sadness we’ve made the difficult decision to close Aftermath. It wasn’t an easy decision for us, as we’ve been quite emotionally invested in Aftermath, but sometimes these kind of decisions have to made in order to move forward as a company.We as a team would like to thank you for all of the support you have given us over the past 2 years and the fun experiences we were all able to share - be it fighting over supply drops, herding zombies for liberation events, collecting resources, crafting, building forts and more.About the GameSurvive against the odds in a giant sandbox MMO world featuring lush forests, dry desert plains, peaceful meadows and the eerie zombies that inhabit the world. Scavenge for guns, supplies, survival items and crafting materials in various zones including cities, farms, military bases, abandoned outposts, forgotten rest stops and hundreds of small encampments left behind by survivors before you.

With over 40+ crafting recipes to be unlocked you'll find that almost anything you need can be crafted, provided you've found the right components.  Loot or craft all the items a survivor would need in a zombie apocalypse as well as a few novelty and lethal crafting options that may be above and beyond the usual survival requirements.  Craft shelter, weapons, attachments, armor, ammunition, medical supplies, food, purify water and set up traps for players or set up a nice peaceful garden to harvest.Town LiberationYou've looted the city and killed the zombies, but what should you do next?  Liberate the town of course!  Now players have the option to repair generators and fill them with gasoline from a nearby gas pump.  Once all the generators are repaired and enough zombies have been killed then supply drops with epic loots will begin dropping all around the town!  Beware though, other survivors will likely be wanting the supply drops as well.  It is up to you to decide if you share the spoils.Supply DropsSupply shipments containing large caches of weapons, ammo, medical supplies and rare guns have been spotted randomly on the map.  Be lucky enough to find one of these alone and you'll walk away armed to the teeth with enough gear to arm your friends as well!Radio Tower ControlDisable zombie sense of smell, sight and sound for a short period of time in key areas to move unhindered and unnoticed by the local zombies.  Find a radio transmission chip and insert it into the console at a functioning radio town in a town to take advantage of this new gameplay.Hundreds of Character Customizations variantsCustomize your character at any time in game simply by opening the customization menu.  Change out your hat, mask or scarf, upper body and legware to match your surroundings.  Don't stick out like a sore thumb in the middle of the jungle with a desert camo outfit.  Adapt your clothing to fit to your surroundings without taking up bagspace.Place-able BarricadesFind fortification in any situation with placeable barricades.  Available both through looting as well as crafting - these essential placable barricades can be the difference between life and death by blocking damage and visibility between you and another survivor attempting to shoot you.  With 7 different barricades to choose from you'll have one for every situation including cleverly placed barricades to enable access to an area not normally accessible.Base BuildingEver dreamed of owning a little piece of land overlooking your favorite location in a game?  Now you can with our totally renovated base building system!  Place down your statue to claim your land and build unhindered anywhere on the land that you own.  Place defenses, harvestable crops, cooking racks, water wells, living quarters for your friends and your own personal storage locker!  Owning a base has never been better!GroupingGroup with your friends or even make new friends with other players in game.  You can't be back stabbed while in a group so feel free to team up with anyone!  Beware they might lead you to some of their not so friendly ""friends"" but that's all part of the adventure.  Take on challenges like the new Town Liberation's or raid an enemy base in style in all matching cosmetic outfits!Stat TrackingWe now make it easy for you to track your stats in game like time played as well as kills and deaths simply by typing /stats in game chat.Harvestable CropsLive off the land and prosper by hiding gardens around the land for your own personal food stash or protect them inside your base.  Once food has been harvested you can choose to eat it on the spot, cook it or use it in a crafting recipe to possibly get even better results.Variety of  GunsWant to play a game where you don't have all the best items the very first hour you play?  We have variety of weapons to find right now.  We have items ranging from crafted and assembled homebrew weapons as well as high grade factory weapons including rare collectors edition versions of guns and different tiers of weapons featuring different recoil, spread and damage ratios.  The rarer the gun, the better the gun.  Show off your guns and skins in a safezone or trade with other players!Melee WeaponsAs much as everyone always wants to be armed to the teeth with the best assault rifle, everyone has to start somewhere and sometimes the best you've got is a kitchen knife.  We've got you covered from simple household weapons to crafted makeshift weapons as well as heavier duty fire axes and maces that deal brutal damage but swing slow.  We're sure you'll be able to find your niche weapon for beating off zombies.PVP ServersUp the anty with a bit of extra excitement in your zombie apocalypse.  Head into a PVP server where it's no holds barred item drop PVP and test your mettle against other survivors if you happen to cross paths.  Town Liberations are enabled on PVP servers to add a bit more risk to the reward of open world ""anything goes"" pvp.  Find unique solutions to player disputes on PVP servers not normally possible on PVE.  Expect players to be ruthless.PVE ServersTired of always feeling like everyone is out to get you for all your precious items and every shadow and sound is terrifying?  We understand that you might feel more like going on an adventure and turning up the ambiance without the constant fear of someone stalking you.  PVE offers a more casual experience for players that just want to practice surviving and looting in the world without PVP combat.Totally new respawn systemNow featuring five new respawn options so players really have control over where they are in the world.  Upon your unfortunate death you can now choose between proximity, sleeping bag, base, group or safezone now.  This really helps players meet up with their friends across the map quicker by taking a quick and dirty respawn or allows you the convenience of being across the map and still returning back to your base in a pinch, provided you're okay with dying :)","Play with your friends in a Zombie Infested World as you face the remnants of zombie hordes & rebuild society in a truly massive sandbox world.
